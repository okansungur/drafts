Whenever you render a JSX component, each and every virtual DOM object gets refreshed. This sounds unbelievably wasteful, yet the expense is immaterial in light of the fact that the virtual DOM can refresh so rapidly. When the virtual DOM has refreshed, then, at that point, React contrasts the virtual DOM and a virtual DOM depiction that was taken just before the update. By contrasting the new virtual DOM and a pre-update form, React sorts out precisely which virtual DOM objects have changed. This interaction is designated "diffing." Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then, at that point, React refreshes those items, and just those articles, on the genuine DOM. In our model from prior, React would be sufficiently brilliant to revamp your one verified list-thing, and leave the remainder of your rundown alone. This has a major effect! Respond can refresh just the important pieces of the DOM. Respond's standing for execution comes generally from this advancement.
