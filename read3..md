### Encryption


__Encryption__ is one of the oldest security techniques; it dates back at least to the Roman era, when a cipher encryption, now known as the Caesar cipher, was named after the emperor Julius Caesar. In this simple shift cipher, letters in the text are shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet to make them unreadable.
For example, if you shift each letter three places to the left in the alphabet, the following clear text:

will become the following:

Modern encryption techniques can be classified as either **private key encryption** (also called symmetric key encryption) or
**public key encryption** (also called asymmetric key encryption). The technical field of study underlying encryption and secure communication is known as cryptography.
