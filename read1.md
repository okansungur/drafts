Internet is the actual backbone that has carved out the path for ubiquitous computing. It enables inter device communication across the globe. The two basic
pillars for the growth of ubiquitous computing are: Internet of Things and Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides reliable service by providing virtual storage and computing zone for processing. On the other hand, Internet of Things provides
a seamless connectivity between objects using RFID, which provides a unique code to each and every object.(Chemudupati et al. 2012)

##### Smart Object
Components of a smart object are:
- Sensors
- Actuators
- Processing Unit
- Communication Unit
- Power Source

##### Features and Challenges of IoT
- Heterogeneity
- Scalability
- Ubiquitous exchange of data
- Energy consumption
- Capability of being tracked and localized
- Capability of being self-organized
- Security

 IoT is all about sensors, actuator, networks and widely distributed smart devices with limited storage and processing capability with prevalent security and privacy issue.
 Due to the communication between interconnected devices, the enormous amount of data generated in IoT often referred as Big Data that brings heaps of strain on the internet infrastructure. This has made organization to look for a solution or alternative to reduce this load and introduce cloud computing to solve this problem by providing on demand and virtual services like unlimited storage and processing power. 

Continuously cloud systems are evolving to provide great support to the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT produces continuous or streaming data and cloud
computing on another hand gives meaning and provides path to this data. In addition to this, by providing remote storage and access to data, cloud allows developers
to implement projects with no delays. Also, taking advantages of this, many cloud providers provide pay-as-you use strategy and charge users for the services used.

The large magnitude of data generated from large number of devices especially from wireless sensor networks, health
devices, machine components in industries can be collected, stored, accessed using cloud services. Cloud management is a complex task (Botta et al. 2016)
Despite having many cloud computing models (explained in proceeding section) and infrastructure it is very difficult to manage and control IoT-Cloud based environment (Alam 2012a).Therefore, cloud based IoT applications should be build to make the most out of their combination. Cloud computing is a popular service that
offers numerous benefits to IoT, by allowing users to perform normal computation tasks using services hosted on the Internet (Botta et al. 2016). An employee may
need to finish a major project that must be submitted to a manager but they encounter with memory and space constraints that can be minimized if an application is
hosted on the internet. The employee can use cloud computing services because data is managed remotely by a server. IoT and cloud computing are ‘tightly coupled”. The combination of these two will enable monitoring services and processing of sensory data generated by devices embedded through sensors.

##### Cloud Computing
Here are some common reasons organizations are turning to cloud computing services:
1- Cost

2- Performance

3- Speed

4- Security

This can be accurately said that cloud can accelerate the growth of IoT. However, deploying cloud technology also comes with certain challenges and shortcomings.
Cloud computing and the IoT are the next-generation technologies. Cloud offer an effective solution for IoT like service management, implementing applications and
services. It can benefit IoT by enabling it to deal with real world things in a more efficient and scalable manner. It can work as a middle layer between things and
applications. Both technologies fills gap for each other like cloud provides IoT with unlimited storage capabilities and IoT extend the scope and application of cloud.
The integration of these two technologies provides path for various business opportunities and innovative research areas as discussed in the chapter.

For the Non functional requirements Cloud can be used. For data storing relational databases are used for structural,transactional data. No SQL databases are used for dynamically changing schema. Some of the popular choices of No SQL databases are Hadoop, CouchDB, HBases, and MongoDB

#### How Cloud Computing Supports IoT Infrastructure?
Computing has been intensively used by many real-life applications like smart cities, healthcare, agriculture industries, transportation, smart vehicles and many
more (Malik and Om 2018). The current trends of technologies are moving towards the use of globally connected smart devices, which produces a huge amount of data
that cannot be stored in locally due to limited storage capacity. The running fuel of all industries is the data, data is useless without its analytics to get useful information
for industries future-plans and policies. The huge amount of data gathered by the smart connected devices needs powered computing systems that should capable
enough to compute this huge amount of data. The local systems are not capable enough to process these data for analytics. These limitations of huge storage space,
computing power and network bandwidth can be overcome using pooled resources provide by Cloud Computing.

   Cloud-Based IoT Environment - Resource Management  
</p>

#### Why Resource Allocation Is Important for IoT?

Cloud resource allocation helps IoT networked devices to utilize these resources in an efficient and cost-effective way to improve system performance and productivity.
IoT devices and resources are heterogeneous and globally distributed in nature, therefore, resource allocation and management are very important aspect of the IoT
environment. The entity in the IoT network system can be an object, a human being or a place that is used to communicate between the IoT system application and
the system user. These allocated objects are known as resources which can be categorized based on the information they communicate in the network.
An effective Resource allocation supports standard Quality of Service (QoS), cost minimization, energy consumption reduction, increase resource utilization and moreover, it guaranteed the Service level agreement between the Cloud-based IoT system application providers and costumers where user’s requirements should be matched in an effective way.
A lot of research work has been done by the industries and academic researchers, but many challenges and issues related to IoT resource allocation are up till now untouched.

##### IOT Jamming Attacks
A jamming attack is the transmission of radio signals that disrupt communications by decreasing the Signal-to-Inference-plus-Noise ratio (SINR) (Berg, 2008)
As these devices are unsupervised the network is liable for different kinds of attacks. Reactive jammer attack is one such attack where the adversary
introduces the attack on sensing any packets in the channel. In this scenario, the source will not be successfully transmitting all its packets to the desired
destination.Path-based Dos attacks, single-channel jamming and multi-channel jamming attacks are some other attacks that should be considered.(Sampath et al. (2007),In Hamieh and Ben-Othman (2009),Deng et al. (2005).
