# IOT
We can represent IOT asa a mathematical representation.(Alhafidh and Allen 2016)

IoT = Sensor + Network + Data + Services

Internet is the actual backbone that has carved out the path for ubiquitous computing. It enables inter device communication across the globe. The two basic
pillars for the growth of ubiquitous computing are: Internet of Things and Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides reliable service by providing virtual storage and computing zone for processing. On the other hand, Internet of Things provides
a seamless connectivity between objects using RFID, which provides a unique code to each and every object.(Chemudupati et al. 2012)

##### Smart Object
To categorize a smart object there are some characteristics.
- Sensors
- Actuators
- Processing Unit
- Communication Unit
- Power Source

##### Features and Challenges of IoT
- Heterogeneity
- Scalability
- Ubiquitous exchange of data
- Energy consumption
- Capability of being tracked and localized
- Capability of being self-organized
- Security

 IoT is all about sensors, actuator, networks and widely distributed smart devices with limited storage and processing capability with prevalent security and privacy issue.
 Due to the communication between interconnected devices, the enormous amount of data generated in IoT often referred as Big Data that brings heaps of strain on the internet infrastructure. This has made organization to look for a solution or alternative to reduce this load and introduce cloud computing to solve this problem by providing on demand and virtual services like unlimited storage and processing power. 

Continuously cloud systems are evolving to provide great support to the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT produces continuous or streaming data and cloud
computing on another hand gives meaning and provides path to this data. In addition to this, by providing remote storage and access to data, cloud allows developers
to implement projects with no delays. Also, taking advantages of this, many cloud providers provide pay-as-you use strategy and charge users for the services used.

The large magnitude of data generated from large number of devices especially from wireless sensor networks, health
devices, machine components in industries can be collected, stored, accessed using cloud services. Cloud management is a complex task (Botta et al. 2016)
Despite having many cloud computing models (explained in proceeding section) and infrastructure it is very difficult to manage and control IoT-Cloud based environment (Alam 2012a).Therefore, cloud based IoT applications should be build to make the most out of their combination. Cloud computing is a popular service that
offers numerous benefits to IoT, by allowing users to perform normal computation tasks using services hosted on the Internet (Botta et al. 2016). An employee may
need to finish a major project that must be submitted to a manager but they encounter with memory and space constraints that can be minimized if an application is
hosted on the internet. The employee can use cloud computing services because data is managed remotely by a server. IoT and cloud computing are ‘tightly coupled”. The combination of these two will enable monitoring services and processing of sensory data generated by devices embedded through sensors.

##### Cloud Computing
Here are some common reasons organizations are turning to cloud computing services:
1- Cost
2- Performance
3- Speed
4- Security



##### Importance of Cloud Computing for IoT


**Communication**: The data generated by loT devices is unlimited. High internet connectivity is needed to transfer data onto cloud.

_Solution provided by  Cloud_: Cloud provides cheap and efficient solution to collect, track and manage anything from anywhere through applications
**Storage**: loT is unlimited source of data which provides opportunities for data sharing, aggregation, processing which needs security.

_Solution provided by Cloud_: Cloud provides virtual, low cost, unlimited, on demand storage capabilities. provides strong security primitives also. 
**Computation**: loT is resource constrained platform with devices having limited processing capabilities.

_Solution provided by Cloud_: Cloud provides Real Time data analysis for implementing scalable, real time, collaborative applications for managing complex events.

For the efficient and flawless operation of smart cities, deployment of IoT and cloud computing is most important. It is impossible to offer above mentioned 
services and visualization, management, processing of enormous amount of vital data that is useful for public or private organization without cloud.
