# IOT
We can represent IOT asa a mathematical representation.(Alhafidh and Allen 2016)

IoT = Sensor + Network + Data + Services



Internet is the actual backbone that has carved out the path for ubiquitous computing. It enables inter device communication across the globe. The two basic
pillars for the growth of ubiquitous computing are: Internet of Things and Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides reliable service by providing virtual storage and computing zone for processing. On the other hand, Internet of Things provides
a seamless connectivity between objects using RFID, which provides a unique code to each and every object.
