ACL,OHS reduces system complexity.
Domain Driven Deesign and microservice based architecture is connected but there is a difference between microservice and bounded context. All microservices are bounded contexts but not all bounded contexts are microservices.As the bounded contexts represent the widest valid boundaries.Defining bounderies wider then their bounded context or boundaries that are smaller then microservices will not be a good idea.as we increase the complexity of system.

Anemic Model: it is a domain model where domain objects contain little or no business logic.We use private setters and entities must be self validated.We should also avoid constructors without parameters..In fact ORM tools create domain objects automatically which leads anemic model.So keeping OOP is a good way of avoiding anemic model.
